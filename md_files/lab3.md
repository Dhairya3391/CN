## Aim/Objective

Study of different types of network cables & connectors and crimping a LAN cable including understanding the difference between guided and unguided media, and learning cable wiring standards.

## Theory

Network cables are the physical medium that carries data between network devices. Different types of cables have varying characteristics in terms of bandwidth, distance, cost, and interference immunity. Understanding cable types and wiring standards is essential for network installation and maintenance.

## Procedure

### 1. Various Network Cables and Connectors

#### a) Twisted Pair Cable

**Description:** Pairs of insulated copper wires twisted together to reduce electromagnetic interference. Most common in LANs.

- **UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair):** No shielding, most common
- **STP (Shielded Twisted Pair):** Has metallic shielding
- **Connector:** RJ45
- **Categories:** Cat5e (1 Gbps), Cat6 (10 Gbps), Cat6a (10 Gbps)

#### b) Coaxial Cable

**Description:** Central copper conductor surrounded by insulating layer, metallic shield, and outer jacket.

- **Types:** Thin Coax (10Base2), Thick Coax (10Base5)
- **Connector:** BNC, N-type
- **Applications:** Cable TV, internet, CCTV

#### c) Fiber Optic Cable

**Description:** Transmits data using light signals through glass/plastic fibers.

- **Single-mode:** Small core, long distances
- **Multi-mode:** Larger core, shorter distances
- **Connectors:** SC, LC, ST, FC
- **Advantages:** High bandwidth, immune to EMI

#### d) Ethernet Cable

**Description:** Twisted pair cable with RJ45 connectors for Ethernet networks.

- **Standards:** 10Base-T (10 Mbps), 100Base-TX (100 Mbps), 1000Base-T (1 Gbps)

### 2. Difference Between Guided and Unguided Media

| Aspect           | Guided Media                        | Unguided Media                    |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Definition**   | Physical medium guides signals      | No physical medium, wireless      |
| **Examples**     | Twisted pair, Coaxial, Fiber optic  | Radio waves, Microwaves, Infrared |
| **Security**     | More secure                         | Less secure                       |
| **Installation** | Requires physical cables            | No cables needed                  |
| **Bandwidth**    | Higher bandwidth possible           | Limited bandwidth                 |
| **Interference** | Less susceptible (especially fiber) | More susceptible                  |

### 3. Cable Wiring Diagrams (Color Code)

#### a) Cross-wired Cable (Crossover)

Used to connect similar devices (computer to computer, switch to switch).

**T568A (One End):**

1. White/Green
2. Green
3. White/Orange
4. Blue
5. White/Blue
6. Orange
7. White/Brown
8. Brown

**T568B (Other End):**

1. White/Orange
2. Orange
3. White/Green
4. Blue
5. White/Blue
6. Green
7. White/Brown
8. Brown

#### b) Straight Through Cable

Used to connect different devices (computer to switch, computer to hub).
Both ends use the same standard (T568B).

**T568B Standard:**

1. White/Orange
2. Orange
3. White/Green
4. Blue
5. White/Blue
6. Green
7. White/Brown
8. Brown

### 4. Cable Applications

| Cable Type       | Primary Use               | Advantages                        | Disadvantages                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Twisted Pair** | LANs, telephone           | Cost-effective, easy installation | Limited distance, interference |
| **Coaxial**      | Cable TV, internet        | Good bandwidth, less interference | More expensive, bulky          |
| **Fiber Optic**  | Long-distance, high-speed | High bandwidth, secure            | Expensive equipment            |
| **Ethernet**     | Computer networks         | Standardized, widely supported    | Limited to Ethernet            |

### 5. Crimping Procedure

### Tools Required:

- RJ45 Crimping Tool
- Wire Stripper
- Cable Tester
- RJ45 Connectors
- Ethernet Cable

### Steps:

1. Strip outer jacket (1 inch)
2. Untwist wire pairs
3. Arrange wires by color code
4. Trim wires to equal length
5. Insert into RJ45 connector
6. Crimp the connector
7. Test cable connectivity
